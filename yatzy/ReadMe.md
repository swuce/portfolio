# Yatzy Game

## Overview
Yatzy is a classic dice game that combines luck and strategy. The objective is to score points by rolling five dice and making specific combinations according to the rules of Yahtzee.

## Game Instructions

1. **Roll the Dice**: 
   - Press the "Roll Dice" button to roll the five dice. 
   - You can roll the dice up to **three times** per turn.

2. **Keeping Dice**:
   - Click on any number displayed on the dice to keep it for future rolls.
   - You can keep multiple dice at once.

3. **Rolling Again**:
   - After keeping your desired dice, you can roll the remaining dice up to **two more times** (for a total of three rolls per turn).
   - If you attempt to roll after three rolls without making a combination, a warning will be issued.

4. **Making a Combination**:
   - After rolling, you can make a combination using the numbers you have rolled.
   - The combinations available are based on the Yahtzee scoring list, including:
     - Ones
     - Twos
     - Threes
     - Fours
     - Fives
     - Sixes
     - Three of a Kind
     - Four of a Kind
     - Full House
     - Small Straight
     - Large Straight
     - Chance
     - Yahtzee
   - If you do not have a valid combination for your selection, it will score **0**. For example, if you select "Ones" without rolling any 1's, your score for that category will be 0.

5. **Ending Your Turn**:
   - Once you have made your combination, click the "End Turn" button to finalize your turn.
   - **Note**: You cannot end your turn until you have made a combination.

## Gameplay
- The game works similarly to traditional Yahtzee, where you aim to accumulate the highest score over a series of rounds.
- Be strategic in choosing which dice to keep and which combinations to aim for based on your rolls.
