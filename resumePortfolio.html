                <h2>Yatzy Project Summary</h2>
                <p>The Yatzy project follows the classic game mechanics of Yahtzee. Players can roll dice up to three times and keep specific numbers to form combinations. Points are awarded based on combinations selected, and each category can only be used once. Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a functional user interface and game logic.</p>
                <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML: Structured the interface, including the dice area, buttons for rolling and keeping dice, and the scorecard layout.</li>
                    <li>CSS: Styled the game board, buttons, and scorecard to create a clear and user-friendly interface. Highlighted "kept" dice visually for ease of gameplay.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Object-Oriented Design: The game utilizes classes (e.g., Dice, YatzyGame, YatzyEngine) to handle the game's data and functionality, improving code organization and reusability.</li>
                            <li>DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updates the dice values, scorecard, and turn management through JavaScript.</li>
                            <li>Event Handling: Listens for clicks on dice to "keep" them, rolls to update dice values, and scoring category selections, providing an interactive user experience.</li>
                            <li>State Management: Manages game state across multiple rounds and turns, ensuring that each score category is selected only once per game.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
